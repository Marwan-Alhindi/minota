# Minota

Minota is a complete 3D second-brain knowledge ecosystem, where your ideas, tasks, habits, friends and AI companions all live together in an immersive digital village.

We believe life’s goal is to optimize inputs to maximize impact. Inputs vary by person, but everyone needs a unified system that blends task management with knowledge organization—and does so in a way that leverages today’s engagement mechanics for our benefit, not distraction.

## Why: The Four Pillars of Minota

### 1. Addictive

**Problem:** Endless engagement hooks in games, content platforms, or social media drive mindless repeat use.
**Minota:** Ties streaks, notifications, and rewards to real habits and tasks so every check-in powers progress.

### 2. Connection

**Problem:** Likes, follows, or chat features often create shallow interactions, not genuine collaboration.
**Minota:** Enables village visits, co-op quests, and contextual feedback on habits and notes for true community growth.

### 3. Uncertainty

**Problem:** Random notifications and loot-box mechanics exploit FOMO but usually waste time.
**Minota:** Delivers mystery chests and AI-driven wildcard quests based on your own notes to make surprises educational.

### 4. Growth

**Problem:** Generic progress bars and hollow XP grinds give the illusion of advancement without real mastery.
**Minota:** Grants XP and unlocks only for genuine habit consistency, note mastery, and task completion—and expands your village to reflect actual growth.
